# Breakthru

**To run program, Python3 has to be installed, then execute breakthru.py!** The program should be self-explaining. The detailed rules can be found on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthru_(board_game).

## Game Setup
This is an implementation of the board game "Breakthru" using Python. The program gives the possibility to let two players play against each other or play against an intelligent engine. The engine is based on the alpha-beta framework using some enhancements.

Player Silver is symbolised using "1" and player gold's escorts by "2". The flagship of gold is displayed as "3". The objective for gold is to reach the edge of the board with the flagship, while silver tries to catch the latter.

If any bugs occur or things are unclear, feel free to address it by an issue on this Github repo.
